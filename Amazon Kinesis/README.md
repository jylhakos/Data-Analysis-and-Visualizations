## Real-time analytics using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

In the following diagram of Kinesis Data Streams, the producers push data to Kinesis Data Streams, and the consumers process the data in real time. Consumers (such as a custom application running on Amazon EC2 or an Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream) can store their results using an AWS service such as Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon S3.
